to my blog! I'm a CS student at UC Santa Cruz interested in systems, programming languages, and how we can use these fields to remove entire classes of programming errors.  I also love open-source software and the communities surrounding it.  This summer, I'm super lucky to be a Google Summer of Code contributor on the Rust tool cargo-semver-checks, which helps library maintainers eliminate the class of errors of not adhering to semantic versioning guarantees.  Check out my GSoC '24 intro page for more info.\nYou can find me on GitHub here, and the source code for this blog is available here.\n","id":"https://blog.mcarr.one/","title":"blog"},"https://blog.mcarr.one/csc-config-guide/":{"body":"Recently, I've added functionality to cargo-semver-checks to control both the lint level and required semver update for each check.\ndefinitions\n\ncheck/lint - cargo-semver-checks runs many checks between versions of a crate's public API, which each check for one specific semver-breaking behavior.  For example, the function_missing lint is triggered when a function in the crate's public API is removed in a new version. \nlint level - For each of these checks, it is now possible to configure the level of severity for when this check occurs.  deny means it is a hard error when the check finds breaking behavior, which will require a version bump to resolve.  warn still runs the check and reports findings, but it is only a warning if it triggers and does not require (but it does suggest) a version bump.  allow means that the breaking behavior in this check is allowed in the code, so the check doesn't need to be run.\nrequired (semver) update - what version bump this check should require (for deny-level) or suggest (for warn) when the check is triggered.  For example, function_missing is major by default, so if a public function is removed between versions, the version needs a major version bump (e.g., 1.2.3 to 2.0.0 or 0.5.2 to 0.6.0).  This can be configured to major or minor (1.2.3 to 1.3.0 or 0.5.2 to 0.5.3).\n\nconfiguring checks\nTo configure the level and/or required update for a check, first find its id.  This will be in snake_case and is reported on error/warning or found as the file name in the lints folder.  Let's use function_missing as an example.\nThen, determine what the new lint level and/or required version update should be.  For our example, let's set the level to warn and the required update to minor.\nIn the Cargo.toml manifest for the crate we're checking, add the cargo-semver-checks lints table:\n# ...\n[package.metadata.cargo-semver-checks.lints]\nfunction_missing = { level = \"warn\", required-update = \"minor\" }\n\nTo configure other lints, just add them as additional entries to that table.  Note that it is not required to configure both lint level and required version update, and you can use the shorthand lint_id = \"level\" to configure just the lint level:\n[package.metadata.cargo-semver-checks.lints]\nfunction_missing = { level = \"warn\", required-update = \"minor\" }\ntrait_now_doc_hidden = \"allow\" # shorthand to set just lint level to `allow`\nenum_variant_added = { level = \"deny\" } # leaves required-update as the default\nfunction_changed_abi = { required-update = \"minor\" } # leaves level as default\n\nThis table should be placed in the current/new Cargo.toml manifest, not the baseline/old manifest.  (this defaults to ./Cargo.toml in the directory that cargo-semver-checks was invoked on, and can be configured to a different path with the --manifest-path CLI option).\nconfiguring a workspace\nIt may also be helpful to configure these checks at the workspace level for multiple different crates in the same Cargo workspace. To do this, in the workspace root Cargo.toml, add a similar configuration table:\n[workspace.metadata.cargo-semver-checks.lints]\nfunction_missing = { level = \"warn\", required-update = \"minor\" }\n\nNote that it is workspace.metadata and not package.metadata.  Then, to opt-in to these for each package that is being semver-checked, one of these keys to the package Cargo.toml:\n[lints]\nworkspace = true\n\nor \n[package.metadata.cargo-semver-checks.lints]\nworkspace = true\n\nEither of these is acceptable to indicate to read the [workspace.metadata.cargo-semver-checks.lints] table for this package.  Using the lints.workspace key can be helpful to indicate this behavior for other linters (e.g., cargo and clippy), but will cause a cargo error if it is set and there is no [workspace.lints] table in the workspace Cargo.toml.  To solve this, we added the package.metadata.cargo-semver-checks.lints.workspace key for compatibility. Note that setting workspace = false is not valid configuration for either of these keys.  To indicate not to read workspace configuration for a crate, simply omit both keys entirely from the package's Cargo.toml.\noverriding workspace configuration\nWhen workspace = true is set, it is possible to override individual lint configuration lines in a package.  For example, if we have in the workspace Cargo.toml:\n[workspace.metadata.cargo-semver-checks.lints]\nfunction_missing = { level = \"warn\", required-update = \"minor\" }\ntrait_now_doc_hidden = \"warn\"\n\nand in the package Cargo.toml:\n[package.metadata.cargo-semver-checks.lints]\nworkspace = true\nfunction_missing = \"deny\"\ntrait_now_doc_hidden = { required-update = \"major\" }\n\nFields set in the package configuration override the workspace configuration.  Thus, the lint level for function_missing will be overridden to deny, and the workspace default required-update of minor will be used because it is not configured in the package.  Similarly, the lint level for trait_now_doc_hidden will be the workspace's warn, but the required update will be overridden in the package to a major version bump.\nlimitations\nCurrently, the configuration can only be read from the new version of the checked crate's Cargo.toml.  If this manifest isn't used (for example, when using the --current-rustdoc to use a preexisting rustdoc output instead, it is not possible to configure lints.  Configuration through other means (e.g., CLI flags) could be added in the future if there is a strong demand for them.\n","id":"https://blog.mcarr.one/csc-config-guide/","title":"cargo-semver-checks lint configuration guide"},"https://blog.mcarr.one/gsoc-24-intro/":{"body":"I'm super excited to be working on cargo-semver-checks this summer! I'll be posting updates here under the gsoc24 tag as I work on it this summer. I love the philosophy of the tool and I think it's a great example of the ideas of the Rust language and ecosystem that let people make correct code more easily.\nsemantic versioning and cargo-semver-checks: what am i working on?\nthis is a little introduction to the problem that cargo-semver-checks tries to solve, and how it solves it. if you're already familiar with the project, feel free to jump to the planned work section.\nI can tell my friends and family that I'm \"adding lint-level configuration to cargo-semver-checks,\" but judging by the blank stares I get, that doesn't make it any clearer what I'm actually working on. However, we all, even non-programmers, have some experience with the problems that semantic versioning and cargo-semver-checks try to solve:\nHave you ever updated an app on your phone only to open it and find out that they, for whatever reason, removed a feature you used to use? It probably broke your workflow, and there probably was little to no warning whenn you went to update the app that this would happen. This is essentially the problem that semantic versioning works to solve.\nWith a piece of software that uses semantic versioning (shortened form: semver), its software version takes the form x.y.z, where x is the major version number, y is the minor version number, and z is the patch number. Take an application cat-petter with version 1.5.2. If the developers just fixed bugs or added minor improvements, they can just bump the patch version and release 1.5.3, and users of this app will know that they can upgrade from 1.5.2 to 1.5.3 without any breaking changes. However, let's say the developers add a feature to pet all pets in a way that doesn't break the original workflow of petting cats (here's a rust analog: generalizing a function), they should bump the minor version to show that this feature was added to version 1.6.0.\nIt's important to note that this only applies if it doesn't make the original use-case in 1.5.2 stop working. Say for example, that the developers wanted (for some reason) to make cat-sitter pet dogs instead of cats. This new version of the app would break for someone using 1.5.2, so they should release version 2.0.0, bumping the major version number, to show this.\nThus, you, the user of the app, can see the version change when you go to update the app. If it's just a patch bump, the contract of semantic versioning assures you that you can update it without breaking your workflow. If it's a minor version bump, you will know that some new features were added, but it generally will still work the way you used to use it.1 If it's a major version bump, though, you know that there is the possibility to break your workflow, so you should be careful and research your decision to upgrade.\nenter cargo-semver-checks\nThere's one problem, though: as a developer, keeping track of all these changes is hard. For Rust library crate developers, there's a cargo guide on minor and major-breaking changes, but it's long, and it's non-exhaustive. It's a lot to keep track of.\nDo you know what is good at remembering and keeping track of things given well-defined rules? Computers are. Just like the philosophy of the Rust language is to eliminate entire classes of programming errors by checking your programs at compile time, we can also check for semantic versioning violations when we are ready to release a new version of our library.\ncargo-semver-checks is a tool that checks library crates for whether they have upheld the semantic versioning guarantees, or whether they need to make a minor or major version bump based on how the library code has changed between versions. It does this by applying lints, one check for each different way that major or minor changes can occur, over the library's API surface, using Trustfall and rustdoc.\nIt's a great tool that greatly improves the developer experience, and, by reducing semver violations, builds more trust in the semver guarantees across the whole Rust ecosystem. A library crate can add it to their continues integration tests, and efficiently track whether they have accidentally broken semver before they push the changes.\nplanned work: how am i enhancing cargo-semver-checks this summer?\nHowever, there are lots of reasons, especially for large, mature library crates, why a project can't adhere completely to the way cargo-semver-checks interprets the semantic versioning guidelines. For example, one project may not consider it a minor-level change just to add a public item. Currently, this would prevent them from adding cargo-semver-checks to their CI pipeline without a lot of potentially-hacky workarounds. We don't want this! All libraries should be able to use this tool without having to agree completely with its default interpretation of the semver spec.\nlint-level configuration\nWe want to be able to configure two things about each individual lint in cargo-semver-checks: whether to allow, warn, or deny (i.e., raise an error) when we detect it, and what semver level (major or minor) is it a breaking change for.\nHere's a general outline of what I'm planning on adding to the tool:\nCLI configuration\nLike clippy and other linting tools, we want to be able to specify the error and semver levels while running the tool: for example cargo semver-checks [...] -Afunction_export_name_hidden -Dtrait_method_now_hidden=minor -Wrepr_c_removed=minor would make the function_export_name_hidden allowed/not error at all, and the trait_method_now_hidden lint now only a minor-version bump, and make the repr_c_removed both a warning and only a minor-breaking change, and all the different permutations of this.\nCargo.toml config\nThere is a [lints] table in Cargo.toml, but it's not yet available to configure third-party tools like cargo-semver-checks with. As of now, we can make a [package.metadata] section using the same syntax as the lints table, and then move over to that when it's stabilized for third-party tools. When this is added, a user will be able to configure cargo-semver-checks in their Cargo.toml like this:\n[package.metadata.cargo-semver-checks]\n# set the semver level to minor for this lint\ntrait_method_now_hidden = \"minor\"\n# set the semver level to minor and only emit a warning\n# instead of an error on violation for this lint\nrepr_c_removed = { level = \"warn\", semver = \"minor\" }\n# ignore all lints of this type\nfunction_export_name_hidden = \"allow\"\n\nThis will also be added to [workspace.metadata] to configure at the workspace level as well.\nAdditionally, I'll focus on adding great and thorough tests and documentation to these additions to make cargo-semver-checks even more correct and easy to use and adopt. I'll be posting updates at least every week under the gsoc24 tag here to document my progress.\nmore possibilities\nThis added configuration also opens up some more possibilities I'll work on if time allows during the summer or after if needed:\n\nAdd a group of suspicious lints that are not necessarily semver-breaking on their own, but are suspicious; they indicate that something is probably wrong but there is a possibility it does not break semver. These will use the new configuration feature of being warn by default instead of deny, because they are warnings, not errors.\nAllow CI targets like GitHub actions be configured directly in the action configuration for lint-level configuration, which will make it even easier and more flexible to use cargo-semver-checks in a CI pipeline\nConfigure whether to apply a lint on a specific module or even item-level basis, such as with attributes as tools like clippy do\n\nI'm super excited to be able to work on cargo-semver-checks this summer and beyond! Feel free to watch the gsoc24 tag for updates on what I'm doing. You can also find me on GitHub @suaviloquence or by email (listed on my GitHub profile).\nfootnotes\n1\nnote that this is not always the case: for example, from the cargo semver guide: \"Some changes are marked as “minor”, even though they carry the potential risk of breaking a build. This is for situations where the potential is extremely low, and the potentially breaking code is unlikely to be written in idiomatic Rust, or is specifically discouraged from use.\"\n\n","id":"https://blog.mcarr.one/gsoc-24-intro/","title":"GSoC '24 Intro"},"https://blog.mcarr.one/gsoc-final/":{"body":"Summer is officially over now, and now so is my Google Summer of Code project for this year.  This was a really great experience for me, and I'm super grateful to have had this opportunity.  I had the great help of being mentored by the maintainer of the project Predrag Gruevski, which I couldn't have asked for a better mentor for this.  In this blog post, I'll talk about the work I did, reflections on my experience, and what the future looks like:\nthe work\nThe title of my GSoC project that I wrote at the beginning is \"adding lint-level configuration to cargo-semver-checks.\"  This means adding the ability for users to configure each individual check of the semantic versioning linter cargo-semver-checks. 1 Adding this configuration granularity will let many more Rust crates adopt cargo-semver-checks to automatically help prevent breaking the semantic versioning guarantees, which helps the whole Rust ecosystem make more fearless upgrades according to SemVer.\noverrides\nTo configure each of cargo-semver-checks's 90+ lints, both by lint level/severity and required SemVer update, I first added a default lint level field (#787) to each lint, then added a new API (#788) to configure overriding each lint's fields.  I had to design a system that supported multiple levels of precedence, with the ability to configure lint level, required update, or both for a given lint at each of these precedence levels, so it took some careful design and adding plenty of unit tests.\nthe [lints] table\nAfter posting my initial blog post, the feedback I received from community members was very helpful.  Initially, I had planned to start exposing the configuration interface as a series of CLI flags (like rustc's --warn &lt;name&gt;).  In this discussion with my mentor and community members like epage, it started to look like a better idea to work on the [lints] table in the Cargo manifest first, and reevaluate the need for CLI flags later on.\nAfter this, I implemented the logic to read a table similar to the Cargo [lints] table from manifests in #799, using the [package.metadata.cargo-semver-checks.lints] (it's currently not valid for tools like cargo-semver-checks to use the [lints] table directly), and in #800, I implemented the logic to use the configured required update, and added tests for the many different interactions, especially with both workspace and package configuration.\nAfter some minor fixes in #804, and #806, I finished the logic for using the configured lint level in #805.  THis was much more design-intensive than using the configured required update, because this was also introducing the concept of warning-level checks to cargo-semver-checks, and I spent a lot of time with my mentor designing how a warning should look like in cargo-semver-checks's interface, and how warnings should interact with errors.\nIn #808 and #809 I added some future-proofing tests and comments to help with maintainability.\ncompatibility with cargo\nA goal of cargo-semver-checks as a project is to be as compatible with cargo as possible and eventually be merged with the tool.  After posting another update on cargo-semver-checks's new configurability, part of the feedback to this was that the current lints table would not be quite compatible with cargo's.  In #811, #812, and #813, I added the functionality to mimic cargo and only read workspace configuration if a key is explicitly set in the package, and added tests (including making sure that cargo-semver-checks denies the lints.workspace = false key, which is insidiously ian invalid state).\ndocumenting\nAt this point, the initial core configuration was ready, so I added a section to the README that was a guide on how to use this new feature in #826 and #829.  I wrote a lot of documentation this summer, both developer-facing and user-facing, and it's one of the things I'm proud of.  To me, documentation is often the first impression of a project, and it can make or break a user's experience, so polishing it is super important.\na detour?\nHere in the project, there was kind of a lull, and I was working on polishing tests and documentation.  However, one thing I was noticing was that it was kind of hard and involved to write a full integration test case.  My mentor suggested that I try to improve the testing infrastructure for cargo-semver-checks, and I thought that was a great idea.  In #846, I added the foundation to be able to write integration tests using the insta framework.  I also spent some time benchmarking to figure out what kind of test (i.e., lib test, bin test, or, confusingly, test binary) would be most helpful to access the right parts of cargo-semver-checks to test while having the fastest possible compile times for better iteration and design.  Here, I also wrote a lot of documentation for future contributors to have the best experience when writing new tests.\nAfter adding this test infrastructure, I wrote some tests that pinned down cargo-semver-checks's behavior for different edge cases, which documented this behavior, prevented any unwanted regressions, and would be easy to change if we decided in the future we wanted this behavior to be different, in #847, #859, #866, and #882.  In writing these tests, I found the opportunity to polish in fix parts of the test infrastructure, like in #865, #867, #881, and #883, as well as #913 later on.\nnew features!\nAt this point, the user demand for CLI-configurable lints when there was already another avenue to configure them was not that strong, so it didn't seem like the best way forward to continue with my original proposed idea of adding CLI flags here.  The project started to go off the rails a little, but in a very good way.  Predrag suggested that I work on a new feature to generate witness programs, which are buildable examples of the downstream breakage of agiven breaking change, which prove that a SemVer guarantee would be broken with this change.  As a fan of testing and correctness, I got to work on this feature. \nAdding witnesses is a big feature, so we wanted the ability to mark a feature as unstable during its development.  Following the design of other tools in the Rust ecosystem like Cargo, I worked on the ability to have unstable feature flags and CLI options in #896, and I added some various consistency improvements in #897, #899, and #919.\nI added the start of the witness feature in #893, and improved the contributor experience and documentation for adding new witnesses in #935 and #933.\nWork on witnesses is currently unfinished ongoing, and this is one of the things I will keep working on as GSoC finishes.\nlint groups\nOne of the stretch goals in my original project was adding configurable lint groups in addition to configuring individual lints, and this feature was seeming more useful than adding CLI configuration flags.  I worked on a design draft, focusing on how a user would use these features.  I started the work by reading the priority field to the [lints] table in #932 to avoid configuration conflicts by defining precedence, and I have drafts of the logic to have lint group configuration, so expect to see lint groups in cargo-semver-checks pretty soon.\n\n...and that's it.  I merged 40 commits during GSoC which feels like a lot, but also not a lot, because each of those commits is squashed and many of them have several parts/squashed commits and (quite in-depth) discussions in the pull request, so the commit history does not tell the full story.\nthanks\nAbout those discussions: I could not get this far in the blog post without recognizing my mentor, Predrag Gruevski. His attention to detail (down to the number of spaces after a period), thoughtfulness, kindness, and careful consideration of every line of code I merged into cargo-semver-checks (and the so many that I didn't) encouraged me to design, implement, and think about the code I submitted from different perspectives and as part of a complex system.  This was so helpful in shaping the way I think about designing features and contributing to open source, and I can't thank him enough.\nAdditionally, the community around the Rust GSoC program and the Rust project in general was a super great environment to be a part of.  Special thanks to the GSoC admin Jakub Beránek, maintainers and contributors like Ed Page and Scott Schafer, everyone else working on a Rust GSoC project this summer - it was such a great experience to see updates and how everyone's project progressed over the summer, and the whole open source community.  I can't overstate what a welcoming experience this has been, and I'm definitely going to keep being a part of the community in the future.\nand an apology\nThe first PR I opened as a part of my GSoC project was... a little overzealous.  It changed hundreds of lines of code, affected multiple different systems, added multiple different features, and was overall a huge set of changes to review.  My mentor (very nicely and diplomatically) suggested I might break up the changes into smaller PRs.  This was a great learning experience for me to reflect on my git hygiene and how to make my changes easier and clearer to review, which is something I worked on and developed over the summer.  I'm grateful to have had this opportunity to grow, and I do apologize for this first pull request ;).\nwhat's next\nThis is certainly not the end of my work on cargo-semver-checks.  Right now, I have three projects I'm working on: adding the functionality for lint groups, keeping working on adding witnesses, and working on a refactor of the command line output of cargo-semver-checks.  With the new features, cargo-semver-checks outgrew its old interface a little bit, and we're working on exploring making it more consistent with the output of rustc and clippy.\nAdditionally, I'm going to keep working on some of my own projects, and I'm also planning on contributing to some other Rust open-source projects now that GSoC is over.  I'd like to keep posting about my journey on this blog, and I made a Mastodon for interacting with the open-source community.  (and I'm always looking for cool people to follow!)\nThanks again to everyone who made this summer possible!\n1\nFor more information about the project, I wrote a blog post describing the problem I set out to solve this summer.\n\n","id":"https://blog.mcarr.one/gsoc-final/","title":"Google Summer of Code Final Writeup"},"https://blog.mcarr.one/gsoc-update-1/":{"body":"Hey everyone! It's been a little while... Here's some updates and reflections on my first few weeks 1 working on cargo-semver-checks\nfor Google Summer of Code 2024.  (You can read my previous blog posts in the gsoc24 tag for an intro to what I'm doing.)\nmanifest configuration\nA big feature of my project was to add lint-level configuration in the [package.metadata] table of the Cargo.toml manifest when running cargo-semver-checks, and this feature\nhas been merged into the main repo.  Here's an example of what you can do now:\nrefresher: cargo-semver-checks runs checks (lints) between versions of a library crate to make sure a new release is following semantic versioning guarantees.\nFor example, the function_missing lint checks whether a pub function has been removed (or renamed) in the current version, which, by default, requires a new major version release.\nCargo.toml:\n[package.metadata.cargo-semver-checks.lints]\nfunction_missing = \"warn\"\nmodule_missing = \"minor\"\nenum_missing = { lint-level = \"deny\", required-update = \"minor\" }\ntrait_missing = \"allow\"\n\nWith this configuration, users can now configure the required semver update (major or minor) and level of severity (deny, warn, allow) for any given check.\nWhy might this be useful? Say a library has different policies than the semver guidelines for one check, for example changing the ABI of a function.  If the library only considers this a minor-level change, versus cargo guidelines' major, they couldn't integrate cargo-semver-checks (e.g., into CI) without much difficulty because this check would not have the right behavior for this specific library's needs.  In doing so, they miss out on checking the other 70+ checks just because of this one discrepancy, which could easily lead to other semantic versioning violations because, as cargo-semver-checks shows, computers are very good at checking these sorts of things automatically.\nNow, the library could simply add function_changed_abi = \"minor\" to their Cargo.toml in the [package.metadata.cargo-semver-checks.lints] table and be able to configure, run, and integrate cargo-semver-checks into their versioning workflows.  This helps prevent semantic versioning violations, which lets dependent crates and the whole Rust ecosystem more confidently use libraries and upgrade safely to get bug fixes and enhancements without breaking their existing code using the guarantees of semver.\nAdditionally, by adding warnings and lint levels, cargo-semver-checks can now run checks on code that don't necessarily require a new version bump.  With this, we can create new warn-by-default lints that check suspicious code: changes that are not necessarily semantic versioning violations, but suggest that there could be a (more complicated) error that cargo-semver-checks can't check with 100% certainty yet.\nworkspace configuration\nAdditionally, I added the ability to configure the lints at the package and the workspace level.  By adding the similar [workspace.metadata.cargo-semver-checks.lints] table, libraries can configure defaults for cargo-semver-checks for all packages in a Cargo workspace, and then override in [package.metadata] for individual crates if need be.\nwhat's next?\nHere are the things I'm going to be working on after this:\n\ntesting testing testing: there are lots of edge cases and tricky situations that came up while adding these features, and I want to make sure that cargo-semver-checks has the expected behavior in these cases, so I will add even more unit/integration tests to our test suite.\ndocumentation/migration guide: with a big new feature like this, we need lots of documentation for both users of cargo-semver-checks as a Rust library and as a binary tool, so I'm going to write even more on how people can use the new configuration in their own projects and code.\nclean up CLI output: in adding warnings, there were definitely areas for incremental improvement in how cargo-semver-checks displays this information to the user, so I'm going to work on improving it and making it more consistent.\nother features:\n\nCLI flags: the ability to pass --warn function_missing, --minor module_missing, and like configuration to the cargo-semver-checks binary instead of/in addition to configuration in the Cargo.toml manifest\nlint groups: the ability to configure multiple related lints at once (like in tools like clippy), for example a suspicious group of warn-by-default lints.\nmore features? What do you think is important for this tool to have? I'd love to hear what you think, in this blog's GitHub issue or on the project's Zulip stream\n\n\n\nreflections\nI can't give enough thanks to my GSoC mentor Predrag Gruevski, who has given endless helpful and insightful feedback on all of my changes, thinking of areas and use-cases that are so important to consider.  Additionally, I've been working on my git hygiene, breaking up pull requests into as small as possible to be easier to review and make sure they are correct (sorry again for the first massive one, hehe).  Additionally, it's been so fun seeing the progress so far on the other GSoC projects and the support of the Rust community as a whole.  Happy coding!\n1\nAlthough the coding period of GSoC has been on for more than a few weeks, my school ends later than typical, so we basically pushed back the start and end dates for me.\n\n","id":"https://blog.mcarr.one/gsoc-update-1/","title":"GSoC Update #1"},"https://blog.mcarr.one/lint-groups-cli-draft/":{"body":"After implementing the core manifest lint-level configuration for cargo-semver-checks, one of the next steps is adding some of the \"nice to have\"extra features that will make it much easier to use and configure cargo-semver-checks in projects' workflows.\nTwo of these features are CLI config and lint groups, and, because they are closely related, it can be helpful to think about how they will interact and design them in parallel (even though they might not be implemented at the same time).  Here are some of my considerations for what these features would look like in cargo-semver-checks.\nlint groups\nA lint group, as the name might suggest, is a group of lints that share a certain property, to be configured all at once.  For context, cargo-semver-checks consists of many precise lints, such as union_must_use_added and module_missing, that each target one specific instance of a semantic versioning guarantee being broken.\nSometimes, though, it makes more sense to want to express something like \"let's make all #[must_use] lints be warnings.\"  Currently, this can only be expressed with the following lints table:\n[package.metadata.cargo-semver-checks.lints]\nenum_must_use_added = \"warn\"\nfunction_must_use_added = \"warn\"\ninherent_method_must_use_added = \"warn\"\nstruct_must_use_added = \"warn\"\n# ...\n\nThe granularity that cargo-semver-checks provides is super helpful, both for writing simple, testable lints and being able to control such precise behaviors, but sometimes, a project just wants to express something like\nmust_use_added = \"warn\"\n\nThis, unlike the current state, doesn't require the project to research and know about the internals of cargo-semver-checks and how it divides this semantic group into individual lints, and it is future-proof against additional lints of this category being added.  For example, the union_must_use_added lint was written around two weeks ago.\nThus, there are scenarios where it would be really helpful to be able to configure groups of similar lints.\nhow many groups?\nOne question that comes up is how many lint groups can a single lint belong to.  It could be one, so every lint group is disjoint from each other, or a lint could belong to zero-to-many lint groups.  The second option could be more expressive, as a lint could be part  of multiple semantic categories.  However, this would add a lot of complexity to the implementation.  Additionally, looking at prior art like clippy, there is precedent for having one lint belong to a single lint group.  That way seems like the best path forward for cargo-semver-checks, but this can always be re-evaluated later on if we end up needing the addional expressivity of multiple lint groups per lint.\ntwo modes of configuration\nAs a reminder, each individual lint in cargo-semver-checks can be configured in two ways: the lint level (allow, warn, or deny), or the required semver bump when the lint finds breakage (minor or major).  Like lints, lint groups will be able to configured in these two ways, with the same syntax for specifying these as individual lints. \nconfiguration precedence\nWhat happens when a lint group is configured at the same time as a lint belonging to that group? How do they interact? In the cargo [lints] table, which cargo-semver-checks currently emulates, each configuration entry has a member priority (set to 0 if omitted).  Lower numbers (which can be negative) have lower priority, and if a configuration entry for a lint has a higher priority, it will override the lower priority.  Since cargo-semver-checks aims to be compatible with the [cargo] lint table, it makes sense to copy this behavior, although the edge cases (e.g., if a lint group containing a lint and that lint are configured at the same level) can become complex, so this will need testing for these behaviors.  Currently, there is a clippy warning lint_groups_priority for this specific case, so cargo-semver-checks could also produce warnings in configurations like these.  Note that the order of the fields in the [lints] table does not impact the lint sorting and precednece.\nAdditionally, as discussed below, priority will also have to be a consideration when specifying configuration through CLI flags.\ndynamic groups\nIn rustc linters, there are also dynamic groups, like all and warnings which allow the user to configure all defined lints or all lints currently configured to be warnings (e.g., to deny all warnings as hard errors).  These could be useful for expressiveness to quickly enable all lints/warning checks, but this does not seem like a crucial feature for the initial implementation.  Eventually, we could have dynamic lint groups for all currently-configured major and minor-level lints as well.\ngrouping the lints\nHere is a rough grouping of the currently-present lints in cargo-semver-checks.  This idea skews more specific (as opposed to e.g., clippy's correctness), but this part I would love feedback on.  Lists of lints by group in the appendix, linked for each group.\n\nmust_use_added - all the different instances of adding #[must_use]\nitem_missing - when a public item is removed 1\nabi_changed - when the repr or ABI of a public item changes 2\nnon_constructible - when a struct or enum variant is no longer constructible\nimpl_removed - when a struct/enum/union no longer implements a trait 3\ndoc_hidden_added - when an item becomes #[doc(hidden)] and is removed from the public API\nsafety_changed - the safety of a function/item is changed in a way that is breaking\nguarantee_broken - a sort of more general category of lint changes that can cause downstream crates to be broken (sometimes subtly) by removing guarantees of a previous API.  This is more general, and could potentially be broken up into smaller groups.\n\nThis would be helpful in situations above.  Clippy's lint groups are more general categories like restriction, correctness, etc., which could also be a direction to go in.  For example, there could be some warn-by-default lints that would fit nicely in a suspicious group.  This is where it could be helpful to have the additional expressiveness of having multiple lint groups for a single lint, but it seems possible to have a creative mix of more targeted/more general categories with only one group per lint, avoiding the additional complexity of many groups per lint.\nCLI config\nAnother feature is being able to configure lints and lint groups using command-line flags.  This is a more complicated feature, and we're tracking user demand to see if it's desired to add.  It's helpful, though to reason about the interactions a potential command-line configuration interface would have with lint groups before either feature begins to be implementated.\nprior art\nrustc-based linting tools (such as clippy) have CLI syntax like:\n--allow (-A) |\n--warn (-W) |\n--deny (-D) |\n--forbid (-F) |\n--force-warn \n&lt;lint_or_group_name&gt;\n\nfor example, cargo clippy -- --deny clippy::undocumented-unsafe-blocks --allow unsafe-code.\ncargo-semver-checks uses these names for lint levels in the current Cargo.toml manifest configuration (but doesn't currently support forbid or force-warn, and it could help for interoperability in the Rust tooling ecosystem to use similar CLI flags.\nconfiguring version\nHowever, cargo-semver-checks also allows another aspect of each lint to be configured: it's required semantic versioning bump when the lint occurs.  A CLI suite would need to expose this configuration avenue as well.  For example:\n$ cargo semver-checks -- --major must_use_added --minor function_missing\n\nIt's tempting to add a shorthand for configuring lint level and required semver bump for the same lint/group at once, but this seems to me like a lot of additional complexity for no real gain in expressiveness.\nJust like with manifest configuration, if a lint/group is configured for one aspect, the other aspect remains the default (or previously-configured value)\nprecedence\nWhen CLI and manifest both configure a lint or lint group, the CLI should take precedence.  This is also the case with e.g. clippy flags and the [lints.clippy] Cargo.toml table.\nFortunately, command-line flags are provided in a deterministic sequence, so we don't need a priority key as we did in the manifest table: we just define (like other linters) the later flags taking precedence over the former flags, regardless of whether they are in lint groups or not.  For example:\n$ cargo semver-checks -- --allow must_use_added --deny enum_must_use_added\n$ cargo semver-checks -- --deny enum_must_use_added --allow must_use_added \n\nThe first invocation would require a version bump if #[must_use] was added to a pub enum, because the enum_must_use_added flag took precedence over the lint group.  In the second example, however, it would be the opposite, because the blanket allow came after the targeted deny and thus takes precedence.\nIt's important to note that these precedence rules apply to each individual property of the lint (that is, version and lint level), meaning if we had\n$ cargo semver-checks -- --major must_use_added --warn enum_must_use_added\n\nthe enum_must_use_added lint would be major-level and a warning (and other must_use_added lintsallow would be major-level and an error).\na less-nuclear option\nThe problem that command-line flags solve is being able to configure lints/lint groups in an environment where the Cargo.toml manifest is not available to use for this purpose.  This could be in CI, using precomputed Rustdoc JSON files, etc., where cargo-semver-checks does not have access to the Cargo.toml manifest where lints would be configured.\nOne alternative solution that avoids some of this complexity is adding a --lint-config flag that lets the user provide a path to a file that contains the lint configuration table.  With this, we only have to reason about precedence rules and edge cases in one format (the manifest configuration table), but there is a way to configure lints in environments where it's not currently possible.\nLike command-line flags, any items in this table would take precedence over items in the package or workspace Cargo.toml.  One disadvantage of this over command-line flags is that it does require another file to be created, managed, checked into source control, etc., but it does solve the problem that CLI flags also do while using existing infrastructure.\nconclusion\nI'd love to hear any feedback at this stage about lint groups, CLI config, or any of the problems, solutions, and implementation details proposed in this post.

If we should raise an error, that's deny. If it should just be a warning: aptly warn. And if, through our configuration or the default configuration, it should not error or raise a warning when this lint is triggered, we allow that lint.\na secret fourth option\nThere's another option in rustc, though, that is even stricter. If we forbid a lint, it's like a stricter version of denying it. There are a lot of ways to configure lints tools like rustc and clippy, and sometimes you deny a lint (such as the unsafe-code lint) at the module level, for example, but you can still allow or warn an individual unsafe block. If we want to prevent this from happening, we can #![forbid(unsafe_code)], and this lint will now always be an error, regardless1 of other configuration that would otherwise override a deny level.\na fifth one?\nThis one was actually new to me when I was reading the rustc lints page. Similar to forbid, there is a force-warn level that will always make a lint emit a warning, even if it is configured to be allow or deny at a higher-precedence config. Unlike forbid, though, force-warn can't even be suppressed by --cap-lints allow. However, it can't be set by an attribute like the other ones, and I personally have not seen it used in the wild yet.\nlooking at cargo-semver-checks\nThe first three are unambiguously necessary to add to cargo-semver-checks to me, as the whole point of adding this more granular configuration to be able to specify the level of each check.\nI'd love feedback on forbid, though. It requires special handling (to be able to override later configuration on the same lint), and right now, the initial plan is to only add three places to configure the lint: workspace and package Cargo.toml as well as through CLI flags, so adding it might not be as necessary as in rustc, where every module and submodule and item and field can have their own configuration, so it's a lot more helpful to be able to override something at an outer level.\nThat being said, if we do add module-level lint configuration, it might be helpful to have forbid, and as a Rust/cargo tool, users might expect to be able to forbid a lint in cargo-semver-checks as in other tools.\nIf you have any thoughts on this, I'd love to hear what you think! Feel free to post on the blog GitHub issue or in the project Zulip stream.\nAs for force-warn, I personally would need some convincing to see why it would be useful to add to cargo-semver-checks, as I haven't even seen it used in rustc lints yet (that I know of).\nconfiguration\nThe point of these lint levels is to be able to set them, of course, and there are so many different ways to configure them in the ecosystem.\ncli flags\nrustc (and clippy, which uses rustc's interface) let the user pass --allow/-A, --warn/-W, --force-warn, --deny/-D, --forbid/-F with the qualified lint name (e.g., clippy::absurd_extreme_comparisons or dead_code == rust::dead_code) to set the lint level at the scope of the compile target. Ideally, a user of cargo-semver-checks would be able to do this for our checks.\nnote: for rustc-registered lints, these can also be passed to RUSTFLAGS\nCargo.toml tables\nThe [lints] (cargo book) table in the Cargo manifest was added to declare package or workspace-scope lint levels. Currently, this only works with rust, clippy, and rustdoc lints, so cargo-semver-checks would not be able to use it as of yet. However, we can simulate the syntax in a [{package,workspace}.metadata] subtable until it is stable for third-party tools to have entries in the lints table.\nmodule/item attributes\nFor rustc lints, you can add configuration like #![allow(lint)] outer attribute to a module as well as attributes like #[warn(lint)] on an inner item itself to apply that configuration to just the module/item. Currently, cargo-semver-checks has a less granular version of this by adding #[doc(hidden)] to an item to exempt it from semver guarantees, but adding this is a breaking change.\nlint groups\nLints in rustc and clippy are organized into groups/collections of lints that can all be configured at once (e.g., #[warn(clippy::pedantic)]). It's definitely a goal of cargo-semver-checks to implement this as well, for instance with a suspicious group of warn-by-default lints that are not necessarily breaking changes at all times, but usually indicate breakage of a semver guarantee somewhere.\nprecedence\nWhen there are multiple levels set for a given lint, we have to figure out which one takes priority, which can get complicated:\n\n\nlater CLI flags take priority over earlier CLI flags (--deny clippy::cast_sign_loss --allow clippy::pedantic --warn clippy::cast_possible_truncation) would make cast_possible_truncation warn, but cast_sign_loss allow (both lints are in the pedantic group).\n\n\nthe [lints] table has a priority key for each entry, such that lower is a lower priority, and higher higher (default is zero if not set). Because in TOML key order is not guaranteed, the order of the lints in the lint table should not be used for configuration, and users should set priority instead if there is a conflict.\n\n\nrustc uses a stack of LintSets, based on how deep the scope is where the configuration is added (i.e., an item is on the top of the stack, its module is in the middle, and command line flags are at the bottom of the stack)\n\n\nCLI flags override the [lints] table\n\ntest for this\nCargo.toml:\n# ...\n[lints]\nunused_variables = \"deny\"\n\nmain.rs:\nfn main() {\n    unsafe {};\n}\n\n$ cargo clippy:\ncargo clippy\n    Checking tst v0.1.0 (/tmp/tst)\nerror: unused variable: `a`\n --&gt; src/main.rs:2:9\n  |\n2 |     let a = 0;\n  |         ^ help: if this is intentional, prefix it with an underscore: `_a`\n  |\n  = note: requested on the command line with `-D unused-variables`\n\nerror: could not compile `tst` (bin \"tst\") due to 1 previous error\n\n$ cargo clippy -- -Aunused_variables\nChecking tst v0.1.0 (/tmp/tst)\nFinished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.05s\n\n\n\n\nand of course, if forbid is found at any point, it overrides any other configuration\n\n\nLooking at cargo-semver-checks, we would need to calculate this precedence ourselves, at least right now. However, it seems like we would just need to worry about CLI flags, package tables, and workspace tables, and potentially forbid, as you can't annotate an item or module. Additionally, we want to be able to configure the required semver version bump as well as the lint level. There is the future possibility of configuring this (i.e., tool-specified configuration) in the [lints] table, such as enum_missing = { level = \"warn\", semver = \"minor\" }, but this functionality is not available in the [lints] table yet. However, we can add it to our own [package.metadata] table, then integrate with [lints] when we can. However, we would need our own way to configure this at the command line, as there's little precedent for providing arguments to lints in tools like clippy.\nconsistency\nannotate-snippets\nannotate-snippets is a crate that creates rustc-like formatted diagnostics for code. You can provide it with level, text, and attach other related diagnostics to the error message.\ncargo's linting tool is currently using it, but tools like rustc and clippy are using rustc-internal diagnostic rendering\ncompiler lints\nTools like clippy register with rustc's linter using declare_tool_lint!. rustc then handles configuration of lint levels and running the lints as necessary, and the tools define the behavior.\ncargo lints\nWhen lints have to run over a crate (including a Cargo.toml manifest), it makes less sense to use rustc's lint handling. cargo's linting is relatively new, and it seems to roll its own configuration, at least for now. (see struct Lint and level_priority)\nconsequences for cargo-semver-checks\nThe lints in cargo-semver-checks are much closer to cargo's than those of rustc and clippy2. Because we need access to the whole API of a crate (and a comparison baseline version of that crate), it doesn't seem very feasible to use compiler lints.\nWhat cargo-semver-checks does differently than other tools is that lints are created declaratively with a Trustfall query over the crate's API, instead of as a Rust constant. This means that once/if cargo exposes the functionality for third-party crates to register cargo lints, it may not be plug-and-play (especially if it expects something with a 'static lifetime, as we need to parse them at runtime).\nI'm not sure how well we can integrate with cargo lints right now, and it seems like I will have to write my own level precedence calculator. However, we definitely want to design to integrate with cargo in the future, and if you have any suggestions for how to do that, I'd love to hear them. Additionally, maintaining interface (like CLI) compatibility with tools like rustc is also a goal as much as we can, even if we don't use the same lint mechanisms under the hood.\nacknowledgements\nThanks to Ed Page, Scott Schafer, and Predrag Gruevski for great info and pointers, especially about annotate-snippets and cargo's linting in the Zulip thread.\nAgain, I'd love to hear any feedback, either in the Zulip, as a comment on the GitHub issue for this post, or by email.\n\n1\nIn rustc, you can pass --cap-lints [level] and it will suppress all lints at a stricter level by capping them to the passed level. This makes even something with forbid an allow or warn if capped.\n\n\n2\nAlthough clippy has cargo integration and lints parts of Cargo.toml as well; see cargo/mod.rs (it makes a Cargo lint pass, and calls cargo metadata - we could technically do this for cargo-semver-checks, but we would need a lot of refactoring, and it would be a little hacky)\n\n","id":"https://blog.mcarr.one/rust-lint-config/","title":"How do Rust tools handle lint configuration?"}},"docInfo":{"https://blog.mcarr.one/":{"body":64,"title":1},"https://blog.mcarr.one/csc-config-guide/":{"body":474,"title":6},"https://blog.mcarr.one/gsoc-24-intro/":{"body":794,"title":3},"https://blog.mcarr.one/gsoc-final/":{"body":985,"title":5},"https://blog.mcarr.one/gsoc-update-1/":{"body":512,"title":3},"https://blog.mcarr.one/lint-groups-cli-draft/":{"body":1072,"title":8},"https://blog.mcarr.one/rust-lint-config/":{"body":963,"title":5}},"length":7},"lang":"English"};
